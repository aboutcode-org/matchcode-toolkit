"""
Halo is a family of hash functions that have the un-common property that mostly
similar -- but not identical -- inputs will hash to very similar outputs. This
type of hash function is sometimes called a locality-sensitive hash function,
because it is sensitive to the locality of the data being hashed.

The purpose of these hashes is to quickly compare a large number of elements
that are likely to be similar to find candidates and then compute a more
comprehensive similarity only on the candidates. This includes goals such as
identifying near-duplicates of things or to group very similar things together
(a.k.a. clustering), as well as to detect similarities between inputs or perform
quick comparisons under a certain threshold.

For a traditional 'good' hash function, small changes in the input will yield
very different hash outputs (through diffusion and avalanche effect). For
instance, cryptographic hashes such as SHA1 or MD5 behave this way. If you hash
two bit strings with a SHA1 function and there is only one bit of difference
between these two strings then the resulting hashes will be rather different. On
average, each time one bit is added to the input, good hash functions have half
of the output bits switched from 0 to 1.

A Halo hash instead hashes similar inputs to the same hash or to a hash that
differs only by a few bits. The similarity between two hashes becomes an
approximation of the similarity between the two original inputs. This simalirity
is computed using the hamming distance or number of non-matching bits between
two hashes outputs bit straings. This hamming distance is roughly proportional
to the similarity between the two original inputs and can be used to estimate
the similarity of inputs without having access to these full input.

The Halo name is a play on what one of the hashing function does: a halo is like
a fuzzy, halo'ish representation of the input.

The bit average function ressembles Charikar's algorithm by using each bits in an
array of hashes but does not use a TF/IDF resulting in a simpler procedure.

class BitAverageHaloHash(object):
    """
    A bit matrix averaging hash.

    The high level processing sketch looks like this:
    For an input of:
        ['this' ,'is', 'a', 'rose', 'great']:

    * we first hash each list item to get something like
        [4, 15, 2, 12, 12] (for instance with a very short hash function of 4 bits output)

    or as bits this would be something like this:

          ['0011',
           '1110',
           '0010',
           '1100',
           '1100']

    * we sum up each bit positions/columns together:
          ['0011',
           '1110',
           '0010',
           '1100',
           '1100']
           -------
            3331

    or stated otherwise: pos1=3, pos2=3, pos3=3, pos4=1

    * The mean value for a column is number of hashes/2 (2 because we use bits).
      Here mean = 5 hashes/2 = 2.5

    * We compare the sum of each position with the mean and yield a bit:
        if pos sum > mean yield 1 else yield 0
            position1 = 3 > mean = 2.5 , then bit=1
            position2 = 3 > mean = 2.5 , then bit=1
            position3 = 3 > mean = 2.5 , then bit=1
            position4 = 1 < mean = 2.5 , then bit=0

    * We build a hash by concatenating the resulting bits:
         pos 1 + pos2 + pos3 + pos4 = '1110'

    In general, this hash seems to show a lower accuracy and higher sensitivity
    with small string and small inputs variations than the bucket average hash.
    But it works better on shorter inputs.
