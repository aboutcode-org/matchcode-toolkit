def ngrams(iterable, ngram_length):
    """
    Return an iterable of ngrams of length `ngram_length` given an `iterable`.
    Each ngram is a tuple of `ngram_length` items.

    The returned iterable is empty if the input iterable contains less than
    `ngram_length` items.

    Note: this is a fairly arcane but optimized way to compute ngrams.

    For example:
    >>> list(ngrams([1,2,3,4,5], 2))
    [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]

    >>> list(ngrams([1,2,3,4,5], 4))
    [(1, 2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 5)]

    >>> list(ngrams([1,2,3,4], 2))
    [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]

    >>> list(ngrams([1,2,3], 2))
    [(1, 2), (2, 3)]

    >>> list(ngrams([1,2], 2))
    [(1, 2)]

    >>> list(ngrams([1], 2))
    []

    This also works with arrays or tuples:

    >>> from array import array
    >>> list(ngrams(array('h', [1,2,3,4,5]), 2))
    [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]

    >>> list(ngrams(tuple([1,2,3,4,5]), 2))
    [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
    """
    return zip(*(islice(iterable, i, None) for i in range(ngram_length)))


def select_ngrams(ngrams, with_pos=False):
    """
    Return an iterable as a subset of a sequence of ngrams using the hailstorm
    algorithm. If `with_pos` is True also include the starting position for the
    ngram in the original sequence.

    Definition from the paper: http://www2009.eprints.org/7/1/p61.pdf

      The algorithm first fingerprints every token and then selects a shingle s
      if the minimum fingerprint value of all k tokens in s occurs at the first
      or the last position of s (and potentially also in between). Due to the
      probabilistic properties of Rabin fingerprints the probability that a
      shingle is chosen is 2/k if all tokens in the shingle are different.

    For example:
    >>> list(select_ngrams([(2, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3), (5, 1, 3), (2, 6, 1), (7, 3, 4)]))
    [(2, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3), (5, 1, 3), (2, 6, 1), (7, 3, 4)]

    Positions can also be included. In this case, tuple of (pos, ngram) are returned:
    >>> list(select_ngrams([(2, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3), (5, 1, 3), (2, 6, 1), (7, 3, 4)], with_pos=True))
    [(0, (2, 1, 3)), (1, (1, 1, 3)), (2, (5, 1, 3)), (3, (2, 6, 1)), (4, (7, 3, 4))]

    This works also from a generator:
    >>> list(select_ngrams(x for x in [(2, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3), (5, 1, 3), (2, 6, 1), (7, 3, 4)]))
    [(2, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3), (5, 1, 3), (2, 6, 1), (7, 3, 4)]
    """
    last = None
    for pos, ngram in enumerate(ngrams):
        # FIXME: use a proper hash
        nghs = []
        for ng in ngram:
            if isinstance(ng, str):
                ng = bytearray(ng, encoding='utf-8')
