MatchCode toolkit
=================
MatchCode toolkit is a Python library that provides the file and directory
fingerprinting functionality for `ScanCode toolkit
<https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_ and `ScanCode.io
<https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io>`_ by implementing the HaloHash algorithm
and using it in ScanCode toolkit and ScanCode.io plugins and pipelines.


Installation
------------

MatchCode toolkit must be installed in the same environment as ScanCode toolkit
or ScanCode.io.

From PyPI:
::

  pip install matchcode-toolkit

A checkout of this repo can also be installed into an environment using pip's
``--editable`` option,
::

  # Activate the virtual environment you want to install MatchCode-toolkit into,
  # change directories to the ``matchcode-toolkit`` directory
  pip install --editable .

or built into a wheel and then installed:
::

  python setup.py build bdist_wheel
  pip install matchcode_toolkit-*-py3-none-any.whl


Usage
-----

MatchCode toolkit provides the ``--fingerprint`` option for ScanCode toolkit.
This is a scan plugin that adds the fields
``directory_content_fingerprint``, ``directory_structure_fingerprint``, and
``halo1`` to Resources and computes those values.
::

  scancode --info --fingerprint <scan target location> --json-pp <output location>


MatchCode toolkit provides the ``scan_and_fingerprint_package`` and
``fingerprint_codebase`` pipelines for ScanCode.io.

These pipelines add resource and directory fingerprints to the ``extra_data`` field.
